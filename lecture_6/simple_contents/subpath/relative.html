<h1>You must have taken a relative link</h1>
<!-- Unless the path is blank, which points to the same path,
     a relative link is not quite relative to the full current URL.
     It's relative to the deepest folder in the path,
     not the page itself.
     The index page has the same URL as the folder,
     but this page does not.
     Nevertheless, it goes to /subpath/index.html,
     not /subpath/relative.html/index.html.
     Even though the full path is /subpath/relative.html,
     the link is relative to the folder, /subpath/. -->
