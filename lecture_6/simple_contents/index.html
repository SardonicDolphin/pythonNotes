<!-- An HTML page contains tags.
     Most tags should have a closing tag later,
     This gives HTML a tree-like structure.
     Tags can contain each other, based on where they start and end.
     The closing tag just has the same name, with a slash in front of it.
     The major tags you'll always need are html, head and body.
     html includes the whole HTML file.
     head includes the title, which is what you see at the top of the window.
     body contains the content that you see on the page. -->
<!-- Do remember to include the encoding as the first thing in the header,
     but the meta tag does not need to be closed. -->
<!-- By convention, the server uses index.html,
     if you give the path to a folder -->
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the simple HTTP website!</h1>
<!-- The image is automatically fetched.
     Also notice that img does not need to be closed.
     An image just contains itself. -->
<img src="auto_loaded.png">
<!-- Links are in the form <a href="[destination]">[link text or image]</a>
     You have to give the full URL, including the scheme,
     but not necessarily the path, for outside URLs -->
<br><a href="http://google.com">Full, External Link</a>
<!-- These two pages exist in the server, so we only need the path -->
<br><a href="/internal.html">Internal Link</a>
<br><a href="/subpath">Internal Folder</a>
